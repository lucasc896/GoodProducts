# GoodProducts

This is going to be the best RESTful api ever for products and stuff.


## Install

Should set variable GOODPRODUCTS_TEST_DB_URL (e.g. 'mysql://chrislucas@localhost/goodproducts_db')
Need to create db? ('test_goodproducts_db' and 'goodproducts')




## Notes
*have ignored the currency in the Price column (looks OK to do from a brief look at tests.postman)
